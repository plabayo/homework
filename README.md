# homework

Free online playground to practice homework.

> Homework is available at <https://elementary.training> for free.

Of course you can also use it within a class setting or anywhere really. Naming is hard.

The goal of this tool is not to replace personal guidance, teachers or parents. It is a tool
that you should use just as you would use pen and paper. Ideally you can sit with your
child and be there for them as guidance.

Please consult [the CONTRIBUTING docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [the Code of Conduct doc](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

For now this website and its exercises are only in Dutch (NL-BE), but we aim to support other languages somewhere in near future.
No promises though.

While I don't expect any security issues, given it all runs as fairly dum client-only widgets on your own machine,
there is always a possibility in this very overly complex world. As such, should you notice any security issues,
of any severity or kind, you can find more info on what to do with that [in the SECURITY doc](./SECURITY.md).
